# Zeki's Note

Welcome to **Zeki's Note**. This is a small site dedicated to taking notes related to JavaScript. I will record some things that I think are important or need to be reviewed, and share them with everyone. If there are any inaccuracies, please leave a message to discuss and let me know. Thank you!

This blog is produced by Eleventy and uses eleventy-classic-blog-starter, which is based on the classic style of [Hyde](https://github.com/TigersWay/eleventy-classic-blog-starter) and modified it. The modification part was made with reference to the blog layouts of [Rhadow](https://rhadow.github.io/) and [Ren√© Winkelmeyer](https://blog.winkelmeyer.com/)! Therefore, I am very grateful to the two bloggers for their pioneering work, which gave me a template for reference. Thank you! !
